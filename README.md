#### Endpoints:
* `GET /movies`: will return all movies from database and their data.  
You can also:
    * filter results by providing parameters in URL, for example `/movies?genre=drama&year=2012` will return all drama movies released in 2012.  
    Avaliable filters:
        * year, 
        * min_year,
        * max_year,
        * rated,
        * genre,
        * actor,
        * director,
        * writer,
        * language,
        * country,
        * min_imdb_rating,
        * max_imdb_rating,
        * title,
        * id.
    * order results by given field.  
    Avaliable ordering fields:
        * year,
        * title,
        * imdb_rating.
* `POST /movies`: important! _title_ field in body is obligatory! That method will fetch movie data from external API, save it to database and return it to you.
